To run the code you have a couple of options. You can run the python code with any IDE you like. 
Just make sure that all files are in the folder where you run the python script from.

My recommendation for the lowest barrier to entry is the following:
1) Download and install the Anaconda Data Analysis package. https://www.anaconda.com/
2) Download the code here as a zip.
3) Unzip the folder.
4) Open up a Jupyter notebook.
5) Navigate to the location where you unzipped this repo.
6) Choose whichever Jupyter notebook you'd like to run the game for (tetrisv2.ipynb or pacman.ipynb at present).
7) I like to think the instruction in the respective notebooks are pretty self-explanatory. They are setup so they
   will install the necessary packages on runtime.
8) Enjoy!
