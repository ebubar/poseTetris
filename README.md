# poseTetris

My recommendation for the lowest barrier to entry to play with this code is the following:

1) Download and install the Anaconda Data Analysis package.
   https://www.anaconda.com/
3) Download the code here as a zip (upper right corner, download as zip).
4) Unzip the folder to a convenient location. This will create a folder Pygame comprising two nested folders - tetris and pacman.
5) Open up a Jupyter notebook.
6) Navigate to the location where you unzipped this repo and open the folder for the game you'd like to run - tetris or pacman.
7) Choose whichever Jupyter notebook you'd like to run the game for (tetrisv2.ipynb or pacman.ipynb at present).
8) Watch the videos for the respective games to see how to play.
9) Enjoy!
